#' ## Overview & resources
#' 
#' I have borrowed heavily from 
#' * Hands-On machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow by Aurelien Geron
#' 
#' load libraries
library(tidyverse) # for general data manipulation
library(caret) # for machine learning
library(forcats) # for manipulating factors
library(corrplot) # for making correlation plots
library(purrr) # for mapping functions
library(recipes) # for creating design matrices
library(stringr)  # for manipulating strings  

#' set params for graphs
theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 12)) 

#' read in data (this has already been downloaded and unzipped from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)
mush <- read_csv("data/mushrooms.csv")

#' ## Frame the problem
#' The aim of these analyses is to predict whether or not a mushroom is likely to be poisonous from its characteristics
#' 
#' ## Measuring success
#' Aiming to predict a binary categorical variable.  
#' Produce a probability of belonging to each class for each observation and investigate the impact of different classification boundaries.  
#' 
#' 
#' ## Quick look at the data
glimpse(mush)

#' change all - in names to underscore
names(mush) <- str_replace_all(names(mush), "-", "_")

#' There's 8,124 observations and 23 variables. Everything looks to be categorical. 
#' 
#' 
#' ### Plot a histogram of everything, with class (response var) as first facet
mush %>%
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = key)) +
  facet_wrap(~ fct_relevel(key, "class"), scales = "free") +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill=FALSE)


#' veil-type only has one value so we'll remove it
mush <- select(mush, -veil_type)

#' ## Create a test dataset
#' Randomly select 20% of the data to be left aside for final testing
#' This can be done with Caret package but we'll sample to show what happens
#' Set seed so replicable
set.seed(1711)
#' create an index vector that samples 80% of the row numbers of mush. 
#' We will just randomly sample and not stratify as we have no prior knowledge to believe a particular variable is important
index <- sample(1:nrow(mush), size = trunc(.8 * nrow(mush)))

#' filter mush - training has row number in index, test does not
training <- filter(mush, row_number() %in% index)
test <- filter(mush, !row_number() %in% index)

#' write training and test datasets into data file as raw data
write_csv(training, "data/training_raw.csv")
write_csv(test, "data/test_raw.csv")

#' ## Training dataset exploration
#' plot histogram of all training data
training %>%
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = key)) +
  facet_wrap(~ fct_relevel(key, "class"), scales = "free") +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill=FALSE)

#' ### Correlations
#' 
#' To do correlations, categorical variables need to be separated out into their parts. 

mush_dsgn_mtx <- model.matrix( ~ .-1, data = mush)

library(corrplot)
#' Then get the correlation matrix between all variables
mush_corr <- cor(mush_dsgn_mtx)

#' can plot with corrplot
corrplot::corrplot(mush_corr, method = "square")


#' Make into a dataframe
mush_corr_df <- as.data.frame(as.table(mush_corr), stringsAsFactors = F)

#' add names and sort
names(mush_corr_df) <- c("var1", "var2", "corr")

#' remove diagonals
mush_corr_df <- filter(mush_corr_df, !(var1 == var2))

#' remove duplicates
mush_corr_df <- mush_corr_df %>% 
  mutate(vars_corr = ifelse(var1 < var2, paste(var1, var2, sep = "/"), paste(var2, var1, sep = "/"))) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(vars_corr)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(corr)))


#' plot which correlates with class
mush_corr_class <- filter(mush_corr_df, var1 == "class" | var2 == "class")

ÃŸ#' As all variables are categorical, we don't need to centre.  
#' Separate categorical vars out to the design matrix using recipes
#' #' leave this bit for now - but I think you can use it for correlations
#' training_des <- recipe(class ~ . , data = training)
#' library(gplots)
#' balloonplot(y = mush, x = class, main ="class", xlab ="", ylab="",
#'             label = FALSE, show.margins = FALSE)
